🚀 Angular Full-Stack Todo Application
Responsive • JWT-Ready • Cloud-Deployed • Dual-Mode Environment
Live Production URL: https://angular-todo-mongodb-frontend.vercel.app/login
Backend API URL: https://angular-todo-mongodb-backend-production.up.railway.app/
A production-oriented full-stack Todo application built with Angular and Node.js, designed with mobile-first responsive principles and deployed to the cloud with CI/CD automation.
This project demonstrates frontend engineering discipline, backend API integration, environment-based configuration, and real production deployment practices.
📌 1. Project Overview
This application provides a complete Todo management system featuring:
• Task creation, editing, deletion
• Completion / undo functionality
• Sorting & filtering logic
• Responsive UI (mobile → desktop)
• Cloud deployment with 24/7 availability
• Environment-based local + production modes
The system is architected to simulate a real production web application rather than a simple frontend demo.

Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express)
• RESTful API endpoints
• Middleware configuration (CORS, JSON parsing)
• Modular route/controller structure
• Environment-based configuration
• Cloud deployment ready
🔄 3. Dual-Mode Environment Configuration
This application supports two operational modes:
🟢 Development Mode (Fully Local Stack)
• Angular runs via ng serve
